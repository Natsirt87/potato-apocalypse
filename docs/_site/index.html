        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Potato Apocalypse is a planet defense game.  The player controls a spaceship and uses its loadout of three different weapons to defend the central planet from spud invaders.  The game draws influence from the retro arcade game, Asteroids. A primary goal of the game is to create an engaging and rewarding game experience through minimal design. As soon as the player enters the game, they should be able to intuitively understand the goal and immediately be able to dive into the gameplay. The game uses purely physics-based movement for the player and enemies.  The enemies attempt to thwart the efforts of the player by shooting projectiles that disrupt the position of the playerâ€™s spaceship.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px;" id="playtesting-reports">Playtesting Reports</h2>

<h3 id="alpha-playtest">Alpha Playtest</h3>

<p>This was the first major playtest for the game, which was done internally among the students of the class.
We learned a lot from the feedback, particularly in regards to what we indicate to the player and ideas for
different weapons &amp; mechanics.</p>

<p>You can see the feedback <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YVBqzZxRjvYiNQWiMAaje7TyktS5JAWrjsr7MSEKiqU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p>

<h3 id="beta-playtest">Beta Playtest</h3>

<p>Unfortunately over half of our team was sick during the Beta Playtest, so we were unable to participate.
As such, we did not get any written feedback from other students during this stage of development. However,
we did have various other people play the game informally and their feedback did positively impact how the
game was developed. They particularly had feedback about the balance of the fry and mashed potato enemy, as well
as their functionality and abilities.</p>

<h3 id="final-playtest">Final Playtest</h3>

<p>For this playtest we created our own feedback form, which was more detailed than the ones we previously used, and
had other students and friends play the game and give feedback. We got generally very positive responses, but still
useful criticism regarding mainly user experience and learning curve.</p>

<p>You can see the feedback <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kWh5rJiiwMC_oAEnVyfWDxV6LI8DdMAW-fSZhrrOEaQ/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p>
